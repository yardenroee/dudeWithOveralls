  "description": "* Background and Overview     * Inspired by the game we all grew up on (and if you personally didn't, I feel bad for you), Super Mario Land.     * The game will aim to replicate the notorious game but written using JavaScript with new implemented features that the       original game never included.. (well it might have but i never got past the 3rd level so tbh idk...) * Functionality and MVP Features     * Create canvas with background image of Super Mario.     * Create mini levels with cinder blocks, spikes, and steps     * Create Mario (Dude With Overalls so I don't get sued) as a moving character     * DWO can move right left and jump up using arrow keys and WAD keys.     * Create coins as elements collected in order to be able to move to next stage     * Make DWO be able to get to an end point in each level that (with all coins collected) will pass him onto next stage           (flagpole)     * Spikes take DWO's life and reset current stage play is on.",
